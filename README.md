### 📊 Key Outcomes  
- The adoption is higher know-how within the Data & Analytics Team, and with knowledge of the database
- Low flexibility in the interaction between user and data: Robust but Constrained: The platform’s robustness restricts flexibility

## 🔥 2) Scoring KPI for FAQ article (Customer and Satisfaction department) 
**Role:**  Product Manager / Data Lead  
**Technologies:** Python - Dataiku - Tableau
** AI models: FAISS · LLM ·  Machine Learning · Similarity Scoring · Clustering  
**AI Hackathon – Team:** B. Pinuela, J. Sabatés, O. Díaz, G. Lucca, I. Yurchurk, E. Llorens  

### 🧩 Overview  
As part of the Schneider Electric “Knowledge Cup – AI Hackathon”, our team developed an AI-driven solution to digitize and structure the company’s FAQ knowledge base, which was highly unstructured and difficult to maintain.  The goal was to enable smarter search, automation opportunities, and improved knowledge management across product lines.

### 🚀 My Contributions  
- Defined the **product scope** and led the functional design for two use cases:  
  - **UC1 – FAQ Similarity Scoring at title level**  
  - **UC2 – FAQ-to-Document Semantic Matching**
- Structured unorganized HTML-based FAQ content into consistent fields (Product Line, Environment, Issue, Resolution).  
- Designed the end-to-end pipeline: **data preparation → validation → LLM scoring → FAISS similarity → reporting**.  
- Coordinated and built **dashboard mock-ups** for similarity interpretation and clustering visualization.  
- Ensured alignment between technical development and business expectations.

### 📊 Key Outcomes  
- Developed a **semantic similarity scoring engine** (title-to-title, answer-to-answer, FAQ-to-document).  
- Enabled **clustering** of related FAQs for faster expert review.  
- Included automatic detection of broken links and inconsistent metadata.  
- Avoided word-to-word comparison issues by introducing **LLM-based contextual scoring**.  
- Prepared a scalable baseline to extend the solution across languages and additional document types.

### 📈 Proposed Next Steps  
- Integrate a **translation module** (FR ↔ EN).  
- Standardize FAQ structure globally (Product Line / Issue / Resolution as required fields).  
- Extend clustering capabilities by product context and environment.  
- Apply the solution to other document families with similar metadata formats.

## 🔥 4) ML:  Recommendation System for Installed base product (MRO)
**Role:** Business Analyst   
**Technologies:**  Python - AWS - SQL 
** AI tech & models: Machine Learning 
 * Scope: AI CoE HUB / BU: Power system/field services
 * Data source: Salesforce (CASE) - SAP (work orders)
 * Status: Deployed 

### 🧩 Overview 
Develop an AI‑driven system that can predict and recommend the maintenance actions or replacement cycles of installed base machines or spare parts. The objective was to provide the field sales team with a  tool that could tell them when to contact a client to offer a new machine. 

🚀 My Contributions: Case model created / Work Order relation

Problem framing: 
“Operators lack visibility into upcoming maintenance needs and upgrade opportunities across the installed base.”
“Decision-making is reactive, leading to downtime and lost revenue.”

Recommendation engine combines:ML predictions - Business rules - Safety constraints - Regulatory requirements
