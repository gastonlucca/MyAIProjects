## 🔥 1) AI Hackathon – Knowledge Cup (Schneider Electric)
**Role:** Data Product Owner / BI Lead  
**Technologies:** Python - Dataiku - Tableau
** AI models: FAISS · LLMs ·  Machine Learning · Similarity Scoring · Clustering  
**Team:** B. Pinuela, J. Sabatés, O. Díaz, G. Lucca, I. Yurchurk, E. Llorens  

### 🧩 Overview  
As part of the Schneider Electric “Knowledge Cup – AI Hackathon”, our team developed an AI-driven solution to **digitize and structure the company’s FAQ knowledge base**, which was highly unstructured and difficult to maintain.  
The goal was to enable smarter search, automation opportunities, and improved knowledge management across product lines.

### 🚀 My Contributions  
- Defined the **product scope** and led the functional design for two use cases:  
  - **UC1 – FAQ Similarity Scoring**  
  - **UC2 – FAQ-to-Document Semantic Matching**
- Structured unorganized HTML-based FAQ content into consistent fields (Product Line, Environment, Issue, Resolution).  
- Designed the end-to-end pipeline: **data preparation → validation → LLM scoring → FAISS similarity → reporting**.  
- Coordinated and built **dashboard mock-ups** for similarity interpretation and clustering visualization.  
- Ensured alignment between technical development and business expectations.

### 📊 Key Outcomes  
- Developed a **semantic similarity scoring engine** (title-to-title, answer-to-answer, FAQ-to-document).  
- Enabled **clustering** of related FAQs for faster expert review.  
- Included automatic detection of broken links and inconsistent metadata.  
- Avoided word-to-word comparison issues by introducing **LLM-based contextual scoring**.  
- Prepared a scalable baseline to extend the solution across languages and additional document types.

### 📈 Proposed Next Steps  
- Integrate a **translation module** (FR ↔ EN).  
- Standardize FAQ structure globally (Product Line / Issue / Resolution as required fields).  
- Extend clustering capabilities by product context and environment.  
- Apply the solution to other document families with similar metadata formats.
